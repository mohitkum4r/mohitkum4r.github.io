      I'm currently a software developer at
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.adda247.com/" target="_blank">Adda247</a> building things for making lives of people learning from ed-tech easier.

      As a software developer, I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering and design &mdash; combining my technical knowledge
      with my keen eye for design to create a beautiful product. My goal is to always build applications that are scalable
      and efficient under the hood while providing engaging, pixel-perfect user experiences.

      <strong>When I'm not in front of a computer screen</strong>, I'm probably working-out, riding bike,
      or crossing off another item on my bucket list.
