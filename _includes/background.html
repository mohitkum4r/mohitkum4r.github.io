      I'm currently serving as a software engineer at
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.pinelabs.com/" target="_blank">Pine Labs</a> where I specialize in developing innovative solutions to simplify lending processes within the fintech domain.

    <p>
      As a software developer, I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering and design &mdash; combining my technical knowledge
      with my keen eye for design to create a beautiful product. My goal is to always build applications that are scalable
      and efficient under the hood while providing engaging, pixel-perfect user experiences.

      <strong>When I'm not in front of a computer screen</strong>, I'm probably working-out, riding bike,
      or crossing off another item on my bucket list.
